# Inclination-dv-Calculator
A Python tool that calculates the delta-v (Δv) needed to change a spacecraft’s orbital inclination. By inputting velocity and inclination angle, it applies orbital mechanics principles to provide accurate Δv estimates—perfect for aerospace students, mission planning, and trajectory analysis.
